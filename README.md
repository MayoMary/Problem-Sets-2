Euler Porblem 5
File name Exercise4.py
##Based on Orginalproblem https://projecteuler.net/problem=5
First I re-created the Original problem for numbers 1 to 10 in Python and got the answer 2,520.
Knowing, my logic and maths was correct, I then I added the FOR and RANGE commands. Name of this script was Exe4range.py
Lastly, I changed the number range to be 1 - 20. As this took a good while to run, I then added comments to say 'Program started' to let the user know that the script was actually runing and then after it gave the answer to say that 'Program ended' to balance it out
I first re-created the Original problem for numbers 1 to 10 in Python and got the answer 2,520.
