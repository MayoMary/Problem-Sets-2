##**Exercises 1 and 2 : Fibonacci**
File names fib.pyand Fib2.py
Exercise 1 relates to the Fibonacci number using the first and last initials of first name. Mary M=13, y=25 therefore looking for the result of 38.
Exercise 2 relates to the Fibonacci number using the first and last initials of surname. Capital M = 77, e=101, therefore looking for the result of 178


##**Exercise 3: Collatz**
File name Cotatz.py
Exercise 3 based on CollatzConjecture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture
Needed to use the 'int' function is how to read integers as numbers
Source of 'int' function was https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20449427/how-can-i-read-inputs-as-integers
Crucial logic n != 1....reads as 'n does not equal 1'


##**Exercise 4 : Euler Problem 5**
File name Exercise4.py
##Based on Orginalproblem https://projecteuler.net/problem=5
First I re-created the Original problem for numbers 1 to 10 in Python and got the answer 2,520.
Knowing, my logic and maths was correct, I then I added the FOR and RANGE commands. Name of this script was Exe4range.py
Lastly, I changed the number range to be 1 - 20. As this took a good while to run, I then added comments to say 'Program started' to let the user know that the script was actually runing and then after it gave the answer to say that 'Program ended' to balance it out

##**Exercise 5 : Iris**
File name : iris.py
Based on studies of the Iris flower by Ronald Fischer in 1936
IrisData https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set
Exercise asked to 'Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.'
Needed to count the characters in the row across so as to divide them up into columns. For example, the first column for Petal length had 3 characters(5.1), therefore needed to cpunt across 0 to 3 so as to include space. The second column then for Petal Width was after Peta; length, therefore was characters 4 to 7 to include a space also.


##**Exercise 6 : Factorial**
File name :Ex6.py
Exercise was to write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
First I wrote code to get the factorial of 5. Once I was happy with my logic and maths, I then changed the script to alow for range 1 to 20.
08/04/18: Having got it working I had forgotten until tonight to then go back and redo the exercise using factorial.
